                    THE PERSONAL FARMERS MARKET LOCATOR AND GENERATOR APPLICATION

About:
This application helps small farmers who sell at farmers markets build a following base. It gives them direct communication with their customers by letting them know where they will be selling their products. It also empowers them to no have to rely on farmers markets to sell their products as well. Customers also no longer have to look for farmers markets and hope that they sell what they desire in a product. They can simply look for markets that are posted, given an zipcode, and see what that farmer is specifically selling. If the customer has questions, they have the ability to comment on the post. Also, if they enjoy the farmer, they have the ability to locate and follow them to see their future posts.
